# Software-Development-Patterns-and-Antipatterns

This is my 22nd book. As always thanks to my wife Eileen for supporting my book writing over many years.
This book is dedicated to Watts Humphrey who was a pioneer in software quality control and effective development patterns. Watts worked at IBM and then helped create the software assessment program and the capability maturity model (CMMI) for the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). Watts was an industry leader in moving organizations from harmful patterns to effective patterns.
Thanks also to the faculty of the University of Florida and to my colleagues at IBM.
